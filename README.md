# COVID19 Voter Opinions - Statistical Tests and ANOVA

- This repository contains files associated with a project from the Statistics for Data Science course in the MIDS program at UC Berkeley.

- This repo has three .Rmd notebooks as well as knitted PDF's of each notebook. Within each notebook I use data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) to ask and answer some simple statistical questions and perform ANOVA tests. 

- Notebook 1 contains a response to the question "Are Democratic voters older or younger than Republican voters in 2020?"

- Notebook 2 contains a response to the question "Are Democratic voters more enthusiastic about Joe Biden or Kamala Harris?"

- Notebook 3 contains a response to the question "Are survey respondents who have had someone in their home infected by COVID-19 more likely to disapprove of the way their governor is handling the pandemic?"

Each notebook is formatted to work properly after this repository is uploaded in its entirety to an RStudio instance.
